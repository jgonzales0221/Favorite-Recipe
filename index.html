            Hello, I'm Johnnae Gonzales, and one of my top recipes is Korean beef bulgogi, a type of Korean BBQ known as 'fire meat' when translated. Bulgogi is said to have its roots in the Goguryeo era (37 BCE-688 CE), where it was initially known as maekjeok, involving grilling beef on skewers.Throughout the Joseon Dynasty, this dish was known as neobiani, translating to "thinly spread" meat, and was typically reserved for the wealthy and nobility. In the medieval Korean historical text Dongguksesi, bulgogi is mentioned as yeomjeok, signifying "fire meat".

            My initial encounter with this Korean dish was through my great uncle, a native Korean who frequently prepared it as a comfort meal for his children, serving as a reminder of their grandparents and heritage. As a child, I vividly recall my uncle preparing this dish, but it slipped from my memory until my husband, and I chose to dine at a Korean BBQ restaurant just a few blocks away from our home in Utah. The rush of memories inspired me to recreate it at home, driven by the savory flavors of the dish and the cherished moments shared with my great uncle and husband.
