        <p class="intro">
            Korean beef bulgogi, which translates to 'fire meat' in English, is a beloved Korean BBQ dish with origins tracing back to the Goguryeo era (37 BCE-688 CE). Originally called maekjeok, this ancient recipe involved grilling beef on skewers. As time progressed into the Joseon Dynasty, the dish, then known as neobiani, became a delicacy for the wealthy and nobility, with its name meaning "thinly spread" meat. Historical references, like those found in the medieval Korean text Dongguksesi, describe bulgogi as yeomjeok, emphasizing its fiery cooking method. This rich history adds a layer of cultural significance to the dish, enhancing the enjoyment for those who partake in its savory, grilled flavors.

            Hello, my name is Johnnae Gonzales, and one of my favorite recipes is Korean beef bulgogi. My great uncle, a native Korean, first introduced me to this Korean dish, which he frequently prepared as a comfort meal for his children as a reminder of their grandparents and heritage. As a child, I vividly recall my uncle preparing this dish, but it slipped from my mind until my husband and I decided to dine at a Korean BBQ restaurant just a few blocks from our Utah home. The rush of memories inspired me to recreate it at home, motivated by the dish's savory flavors and the cherished moments I shared with my great uncle and husband.
